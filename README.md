## Data and Preparation

This project uses the **Data Professional Survey** Excel dataset, which contains demographic, job, salary, education, and satisfaction information for hundreds of respondents working in or aspiring to work in data-related roles.
The raw data was cleaned and transformed by standardizing and structuring key columns such as job title, country, salary, age, favorite programming language, and multiple happiness scores so they could be reliably used in visuals, filters, and aggregations within Power BI.

## Main Metrics Created

- Calculated the total **count of survey takers** (628) to represent the overall sample size directly on the dashboard as a key indicator.  
- Computed the **average age** of respondents (approximately 29.86 years) to provide a quick demographic overview of the surveyed population.
- Built measures for **average salary by job title**, enabling comparison across roles such as Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Architect, Database Developer, and Students.

## Visuals and Insights

- Designed a bar chart for **Average Salary by Job Title**, highlighting which roles earn higher or lower average salaries within the survey results.
- Created a bar chart for **Favourite Programming Language**, comparing the number of respondents who chose Python, R, Other, C/C++, JavaScript, and Java.
- Added a country-level visual showing the **distribution of survey takers by country**, with emphasis on Canada, India, United Kingdom, United States, and an aggregated “Other” group.

## Satisfaction Analysis

- Built card and chart visuals to show **average happiness with work–life balance** (around 5.75 out of 10) and **average happiness with salary** (around 4.27 out of 10), summarizing key aspects of job satisfaction among respondents.
- Created a visual for **Difficulty to break into data**, categorizing responses into “Very Easy”, “Easy”, “Neither easy nor difficult”, “Difficult”, and “Very Difficult”, and displaying counts such as 268 and 134 for the largest groups to show how challenging people found entering the data field.
